We handled this porject mainly by applying the algorithms we did in class by translating them into code.
The trickiest parts of the problem were dealing with hexadecimal conversions both to and from.
This is becasue we had to think of either our input or output as a string instead of just transtioning from numbers to numbers like the other conversions.
We did this by creating arrays of characters and just converting each digit or set of digits into the corresponding character.
